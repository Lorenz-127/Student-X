## User Experience
### Main Idea
The idea for this website was not the first thing that came to my mind. I thought, after seeing some examples of project websites, that they were all good examples, some with a real connection, others describing a hobby or even fictitious companies. I said to myself, 'OK, you can do that, you can still do that at the age of 50. So I started to think about what I could do. Something unusual like a traditional recipe from my home country or a page about a museum or a person. After doing some research on various topics, I came up with the following.

- Who am I? 
- Why am I doing this course?
- Where do I want it to take me?
- How can I motivate others to do it?

  I am 50 years old, Generation X.  
  So I am student X.
  And that's how the idea for this site was born.

### Project Goal

## Design  

### Colour Scheme

- The idea for this colour scheme was to choose a dark theme, as I am a dark-mode advocate. In addition to the theme, I added the brand-colours of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are also some additional colours, e.g. for the quiz for shadows and other utilities.

![colour palette](assets/feature-img/colors.png)

- The colour scheme is reflected in all pages and features. For example, the links to the pages are highlighted in the corresponding colour and the features such as the scroll button shows the HTML colour in its resting state, as it is an HTML element. However, as soon as it is actively used, the colour changes to JavaScript and CSS as the function and style is controlled by these parts. Even if the button works solely in vanilla CSS, the colours are appropriate.

### Typography

- The fonts for this project are from google fonts.
  - The Title Font is Montserrat the websafe font is Verdana and as fallback it would be sans-serif.

  ![Montserrat](assets/feature-img/font-title.png)

  - the Text Font is Work Sans the websafe font is Tahoma and the fallback would be sans-serif.

  ![Work-Sans](assets/feature-img/font-text.png)

### Wireframes  

#### Lofi Design

- Wireframe with basic layout after the first grid design failed. I didn't draw all the different pages, but this visualisation helped me to get a better overview of the new design.

#### Home 
- Desktop large

## Features

### Header
- 
- The header differs from larger to smaller screens.
- The navbar link shows the colour of the page the user is on.

  - On devices larger than 992px, the menu button disappears, and the navigation is traditionally displayed in the header.
  ![header desktop](assets/feature-img/navigation-large.png)

  - On tablets, the navigation bar slides in horizontally to cover as little of the content as possible.

  ![header tablet](assets/feature-img/navigation-medium-open.png)

  - On mobile devices, the menu button allows the navigation bar to slide in vertically in a narrow version so as not to cover the entire screen.

  ![header mobile](assets/feature-img/navigation-small.png)


### Footer
- The footer stays consistence throughout the whole design on all devices and screen-sizes
- On hover the social media icons change their colour to the html utility colour.

![Footer](assets/feature-img/footer.png)

### Home

- The home hero card box contains the 3 logos for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each of which leads to its corresponding page when clicked on hover.
- The homepage contains 5 reasons why a career change makes sense.

![home](assets/feature-img/home-full.png)

### HTML

- On the HTML page, a boilerplate HTML code is shown in a picture.
- The card boxes explain why HTML is useful to learn.
- The navbar link shows the associated colour to HTML as an indicator on which site the user is.

![html](assets/feature-img/html-full.png)
### CSS

- The CSS site also follows this concept.
- The navbar link shows the associated colour to CSS as an indicator on which site the user is.
- First, a short introduction to what CSS is,
- Then the basics of CSS are explained in a sample code.
- The code that is used in the screenshots originates from the website on which the user is visiting.

![css](assets/feature-img/css-full.png)

### JavaScript

- The JavaScript page first shows a digital clock in the Hero/Home card box, followed by the script for this displayed clock.
- The navbar link shows the associated colour to JavaScript as an indicator on which site the user is.
- In the card below the example of the script above is explained.
- This introduces the user to the basics of JavaScript.

![js](assets/feature-img/js-full.png)


### Quiz

- The quiz is intended to be an interactive way for users to reflect on the content of the website through a playful approach.
- It is also intended to motivate users to find out more about front-end developers as a career change.

![quiz](assets/feature-img/quiz-full.png)

### Required fields responses:

- Name field

![Name](assets/feature-img/field-required-name.png)

### Existing Features

### Menu Toggle

  - This function is intended to improve the user experience on mobile devices and tablets.
  - Even though it is a common practice here to use an icon from e.g. Fontawesome, I decided to create the burger buttons with vanilla CSS.
  - To do this, I gave three span elements the necessary styling in CSS.

![burger-button](assets/feature-img/burger-snapshot.png)

![burger-button-close](assets/feature-img/burger-button-close.png)

  - In addition, when clicked, the burger icon transforms into a red X to indicate to the user that they can also close the menu.

![burger-button-transform](assets/feature-img/burger-button-transform.png)

![burger-button-open](assets/feature-img/burger-button-open.png)



### Scroll To Top and Bottom - Button

  - Designed in the Main Colour Theme of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Brand colours
  - The element presents itself in the HTML colors due to its position within an HTML element.

![scroll-css](assets/feature-img/scroll-css-snapshot.png)

  - “On Hover” The Button becomes his action Colours for style and function represented by Background-colour of JavaScript and icon-Colour of CSS.
  - Another small detail is the transform: translateY option, which shifts the icon by 4 pixels in the direction in which it is to be scrolled. 
  - To make this process more pleasant for the user, the movement is delayed by 200ms.

![scroll-icon-css](assets/feature-img/scroll-icon-css-snapshot.png)

  - Even if the function was not implemented with JavaScript, it is still a suitable analogy to the basic interaction of the three components.
  - In addition I added a scroll-behavior of smooth for the entire page so that the page can be better perceived.

![scroll](assets/feature-img/scroll-snapshot.png)

### Buttons call to action / Submit

  - The Button present himself in the overall colour theme.

![submit-button](assets/feature-img/call-to-action.png)

  - The style of the buttons is set as a global rule, so it applies to all buttons.

![submit-button-cs](assets/feature-img/call-to-action-css.png)

  - On-hover the button, inverse the Colours to give the user a visual response on action.

![submit-button-hover](assets/feature-img/call-to-action-hover.png)

### radio button quiz

- The answers are highlighted in colour when clicked on, so that a visual engagement with the user is also created here.
- The colours represent whether the user's answer is correct (in green) or incorrect (in red).

![quiz-feature](assets/feature-img/quiz-feature.png)

- All elements are focusable with keyboard to make the page as accessible as possible.

### submit form with dropdown

- The form is a call to action. 
- The name and email address fields are kept simple to minimise the user's need to submit the form.
- With the dropdown, the user can set his age group and is motivated to learn more about software programming with the button. 

![submit-form](assets/feature-img/submit-form.png)

### Video from CI

- The whole website aims to show that changing careers is a good choice even in your mid-40s. This video is ideal to increase this motivation.
- The video is also responsive and available on all common devices.

![responsive-video](assets/feature-img/video-confirmation-page.png)

### Further call to action

- The two card boxes below the video ask the user one last time for further information 
  in the form of the blog, or even to register for the 5dcc. 
- Both links lead directly to the respective content on the CI website in a new tab.

![further-call-to-action](assets/feature-img/further-call-to-action.png)

### Accessibility

- I used alt="", aria-labels and semantic elements like as much as possible to make the site easy to navigate and understand by keyboard and/or screen reader users.
- I made a small compromise with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages. 
- The colours on the links to the respective pages are part of the colour concept of the website. 
- However, these three links resulted in a poor contrast rating but overall a minimal change in the overall accessibility rating.
- Also, the digital numbers from the clock example are made of text elements, which is not ideal for screen readers.
- The rating is never less than 94% on all pages.

### Features Left to Implement

#### Theme toggle
  - The idea is that the user can switch between dark and light mode.
    In the associated script In addition, it can be specified that the selected theme 
    is saved to local-storage so that the user does not have to switch again the next time visit.

#### Language toggle
  - It is planned to make the site available in other languages ​​as well. For example, in German.
    To point out that the Government supports such qualifications with an education voucher.

#### Html / CSS / JS embedded code editor
  - The idea is to integrate a mini code editor into the respective page, so that the user can 
    practice directly in order to increase the motivation to do a retraining, and thus show that they can also do it.

#### Quiz form
  - The quiz should send an evaluation of the answers to the server and produce a result.
  - This is displayed on the confirmation page, with a motivational text that confirms 
    that you are suitable for retraining as a software developer.

[Top](#contents)

### Unfixed Bugs

- Issue 10 Video does not align with other card-box containers on smaller screens

![error-10-error](assets/feature-img/issue-10-error.png)

  - The video container does not have the same margin distance on smaller devices as the other card-box containers. 
    Error not yet fixed because this error has a lower priority due to the deadline. 

    I had a solution for the problem. But it did not pass the W3C validation. 
    Since I use a third-party code for the video in both cases, I leave it as it is and live with the error.

    The video is also 100% responsive with the code used, and therefore the UX is guaranteed.

- Issue V-5 toggle menu don't change status anymore due to refactor to avoid validation error.
  - I am not able to solve the problem without changing the entire structure or mechanics of the navigation bar.
  - I could use JavaScript to solve the problem, but this would not meet the project scope.
  - Due to the approaching deadline, I have decided to deliver a functional menu. This is guaranteed. 
  - The slide in effect works and the menu is fully responsive.

### Content

#### Slide-in navbar and Burger menu
- The inspiration for these two features came to me during class. On the one hand, I wanted a burger menu, but not a copy of the Love Running   tutorial. I also wanted to avoid a simple solution with JavaScript and implement the function with vanilla CSS. From the lesson on UX design, I then had the idea for the slide-in menu to deviate sufficiently from the original from the walkthrough project. 
    I got the inspiration from [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp) and this is my attempt to implemented it without JavaScript.

#### "Scroll To Top and Bottom" Button
  - This feature caught my attention when looking through example projects, shown by our cohort facilitator, where such a button was missing, in addition I added a scroll smooth so that the page can be better perceived. Again, I found what I was looking for on [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp). There was only one example with JavaScript, but it gave me enough information to implement the element myself in vanilla CSS.

#### Text Content
  - The text for the articles relating to career change is paraphrased by me, with inspiration from the site [claremontconsulting.com](https://www.claremontconsulting.com/why-become-a-front-end-developer#:~:text=Front-end%20developers%20have%20a,digital%20products%20is%20incredibly%20rewarding)
  - In addition, there is some content from the Code Institute [Career Support](https://codeinstitute.net/de/career-hub/?_gl=1*4muh7x*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg0OTgxNjY4Mi4xNzE0NjY4Njc1*_ga_QFGPY7G0M3*MTcxNDY2ODY3NC4xLjAuMTcxNDY2ODY3NC4wLjAuNzQzNDk5MTc1) Website.

## Most importantly:
### My wife, who encourages me in all my endeavours, and without her unwavering support, none of this would be possible.
